# Patch notes:


### 1.1.1 Database hooked up

* `connection.php` was added in the folder `\includes` so it can be included in everything.
* `msgCreate.php` was added to send the data from the form on Ã¬ndex.php` to the database.
* There is a label for usernames in the database, this feature is planned for the next patch.
* The user still needs to be able to see the messages that were send. This will be added aswell.
